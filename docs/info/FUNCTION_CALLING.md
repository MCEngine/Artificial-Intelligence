# ðŸ§  Function Calling Example

Hereâ€™s an example of a supported `json` file:

```json
[
  {
    "match": [
      "hello",
      "hi",
      "hey",
      "greetings",
      "yo",
      "sup"
    ],
    "response": "Hello {player_name}! ðŸ‘‹ How can I help you today?"
  }
]
```

If the player says `Hello`, the plugin will only send the matched line:

```pgsql
player --> [You â†’ AI]: Hello  
sent to AI --> [You â†’ AI]: Hello Hello {player_name}! ðŸ‘‹ How can I help you today?
```

ðŸ”„ Only the matched message and response are sent â€” not the entire file.

# ðŸ”§ Parameter Support

You can use the following dynamic placeholders in your responses:

`{player_name}` â†’ Replaced with the playerâ€™s name

`{player_uuid}` â†’ Replaced with the playerâ€™s UUID
